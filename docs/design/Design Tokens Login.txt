Design Tokens Login Panel

font-family = Open Sans

The colors of the background and the title are the same as the standard panel.
Size should be appropriate for the contents.  We can adjust this at the end.

The logo in the title is 35 x 35 (CRG Logo 2025.webp)

The background picture is CRG Background NEW 2025.webp.  This is being displayed right now but it is being truncated.  It falls short of the footer.  There is a gap of about an inch between the picture and the top of the footer.  Also, the bottom part of the image appears to have been cut off.  Would like to see the whole thing.

What is unique is:

buttons have corner radius = 5
